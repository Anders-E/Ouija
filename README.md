### Build & Run Ouija for development
For development purposes, scripts exist to set up listeners for file changes:

| Script        | Description                                                                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| watch-all     | Runs all the watchers described below                                                             |
| watch-webpack | Listens for changes in the client code and bundles it into bundle.js                              |
| watch-ts      | Listens for changes in the server code and compiles it to JavaScript                              |
| watch-node    | Runs server and listens for changes in server code. Restarts the server whenever changes are made |

For example, to run the server and watch for any changes to any code in the project simply run `npm run watch-all` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Code Style, ESLint & Prettier

Ouija uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to check for and fix stylistic code errors:

- To run check for stylistic errors, run `npm run style-check`.
- To fix any auto-fixable errors, run `npm run style-fix`.

It is recommended to do this before any commit to keep style as consinstent as possible.

Many editors have plugins for ESLint which displays any stylistic errors in the editor:

| Editor             | Plugins                                                                              |
